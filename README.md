# Personal-Album-Storage
A personal web application project used to store and access a database of musical albums.  I created this project to learn more about SQL, PHP and Bootstrap for simple styling.  Next steps are to add multiple tables and create filters that join with the other table, perhaps a table of artists and record labels.  Looking to add some javascript to make it more interesting and functional (ie. filtering, effects, etc).
