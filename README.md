# Personal-Album-Storage
A personal web application project used to store and access a database of musical albums.  I created this project to learn more about SQL and PHP.  Next steps are to add multiple tables and create filters that join with the other table, perhaps a table of artists and record labels.

Styling is still a work in progress.
